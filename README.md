## Key Projects

### 1. **Dynamic Malware Analysis**  
- **Objective**: Analyze malware samples to identify behavior and persistence mechanisms.  
- **Techniques**:  
   - Monitored system changes, dropped files, and registry keys using dynamic analysis.  
   - Identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as malicious domains, hashes, and IP addresses.  
- **Outcome**: Documented findings and developed YARA rules for malware detection.  

### 2. **Phishing Email Investigation**  
- **Objective**: Analyze phishing emails to identify malicious payloads and links.  
- **Techniques**:  
   - Extracted email headers, inspected attachments, and sandboxed suspicious files.  
- **Outcome**: Identified malicious links, recommended blocklists, and provided mitigation strategies.  

### 3. **SIEM Alert Investigation**  
- **Objective**: Investigate SIEM alerts for web attacks and brute-force attempts.  
- **Techniques**:  
   - Correlated logs and identified attack patterns in the LetDefend SIEM dashboard.  
   - Monitored real-time data to track malicious behavior.  
- **Outcome**: Proposed firewall rules, IP blocking, and alert prioritization strategies.  

### 4. **Building a Malware Analysis Lab**  
- **Objective**: Develop a secure and isolated malware analysis environment.  
- **Techniques**:  
   - Configured virtual machines and sandbox tools for safe malware execution.  
- **Outcome**: Successfully analyzed malware samples without risk to host systems.
